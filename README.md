I implemented the Erlang-B formula through Matlab and calculated the total traffic load provided by the following system parameters: Channel: 1-20, 200-220, blocking rate: 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%.
 It can also calculated the actual traffic load and spectral efficiency.
 You can modify the Channel number in the code to get different total traffic load, actual traffic load and spectral efficiency.
